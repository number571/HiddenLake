The `Hidden Lake Notifier` is a group chat based on two objectives of anonymizing `QB+Crowds`. QB task (generated by the HLS application) It provides anonymity from a global observer, and the Crowds protocol provides anonymity from direct communication subscribers.

## Installation

```bash
$ go install github.com/number571/hidden-lake/cmd/hln@latest
```

## How it works

TODO...

## Supported platforms

- Windows (x86_64, arm64)
- Linux (x86_64, arm64)
- MacOS (x86_64, arm64)

## Build and run

Default build and run

```bash 
$ go run ./cmd/hln

> [INFO] 2023/06/03 15:30:31 HLN is running...
> ...
```

Open ports `9561` (HTTP, interface) and `9562` (HTTP, incoming).
Creates [`./hln.yml`](./hln.yml) and `./hlm.db` files.

## Running options

```bash
$ hln --path /root
# path = path to config and database files
```

## Example

The example will involve four nodes `node1_hlm, node2_hlm, node3_hlm` and `middle_hla_tcp`. The `HLA=tcp` node is only needed for communication between `node1_hlm, node2_hlm, node3_hlm` nodes. Each of the remaining ones is a combination of HLS and HLN, where HLN plays the role of an application and services.

Build and run nodes
```bash
$ cd examples/notifier/simple
$ make
```
